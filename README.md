# PWD_Encrypted
_Password Generator with Fernet Encryption_

### SUMMARY
PWD_Encrypted is a very basic password generator written in python including Fernet.
Fernet is an implementation of symmetric (also known as “secret key”) authenticated cryptography.
Fernet guarantees that a message encrypted using it cannot be manipulated or read without the key.
